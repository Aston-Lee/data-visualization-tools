## INTRODUCTION
I want to share with you a situation that draws my attention about exploratory data analysis(EDA).
When I look at exploratory data analysis I observe that most of the plots or graphs are ordinary like bar plots, heat maps for correlation and maps.
Although I like reading different kernels and exploring varied datasets, same visualization plots are boring for me and they do not improve me.
On the other hand, in order to make better visualization, you need to improve and fill with more visualization technique your graphic repository.
Therefore, I make tutorial about rare visualization techniques. Some of the plots or graphs can be familiar for you but as much as I can, I will try to visualize different graphics.
Python is open source and diffent libraries can be used. Lets look at which visualization libraries we will use.

1. Matrix and Box Plots (Missingno)
1. Parallel Plots (Pandas)
1. Network Charts (Networkx)
1. Venn (Matplotlib)
1. Donut (Matplotlib)
1. Spider Chart (Matplotlib)
1. Cluster Map (Seaborn)
1. Inset Plots (Plotly)
1. Basic 3D Scatter Plot (Plotly)
1. Earthquare Animation (Plotly) https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/earthquake-animation-with-plotly
